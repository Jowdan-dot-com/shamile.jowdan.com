<h3 id=1>Backstory...</h3>
<p> well <i>I</i> like alot of people with a 2d backstory and not the plain <i>I am evil because I am</i> type of back story have a back story to how it <b>all</b> started</p>
<p> I still remember how it started, there were blocked websites that I wanted to access... like alot of people </p>
<p> I remember watching videos about wii homebrew when I was younger, a time where I wanted to mod a wii just like my dad did... </p>
<p> unenrollment felt like a jail break for the wii but instead it was for a chromebook. </p>
<p> I tried to get unenrolled but my stupidity held me back alot, I couldn't setup Icarus with my own server so when I found out a pretty risky <b> not recomended </b> public server that could get me <b> compermised</b> if I didn't disconnect from the server ASAP after the setup (I did) I could've been this thing called cooked </p>
<p> In more detail I could've been hacked :( </p>
<h3 id=2> How I did it </h3>
<p> this explanation assumes you have some sort of a computer mind... </p>
<p> So... for this exploit I think you had to be under v129 or v127 or something like that idk </p>
<p> oh btw v129 / v127 or vany version idk, means a chrome os version and I am saying you had to be under it, right now as of 1/30/26 the newest version of cros (Chrome OS) is v144 but I can still say some people are still under v144 since it just came out</p>
<p> and in order to downgrade versions there is a downgrade limit called a kernver / kernel version, and for kernvers 0-1 its any version 2 is v112 but what matters is for kv 4 (kernver 4) it is v125 which lets us downgrade below v129 / v127 </p>
<p> how you downgrade? Simple you just flash a recovery image in that range v125-v129 for your board (group of chromebooks) to a usb and go into recovery mode (esc + refrsh + pwer) and </p>
<p> I made sure I was fine by downgrading to v125 </p>
<p> Then I booted sh1mmer... oh no I have to explain how to boot into sh1mmer, you remember that popular exploit people were using to unenroll back in the day and it got patched... you will see its importance even if it got patched... when I tell you </p>
<p> First I went into recovery mode (look above this I just told you how I do that) then pressed control + d, then enter to confirm to switch into developer mode, my school admins blocked it, but even if its blocked I could go into recovery mode again and boot a sh1mmer leagcy (sh1mmer leagcy is sh1mmer but no graphical user interface and it is more up to date) I went into payloads and selected Icarus it did things to cros so I could turn it back on and contiune... </p>
<p> it rebooted and it was powerwashed I mean thats what happens when you turn on / off developer mode which we did by enabling it ealier by pressing control + d and enter then the Icarus payload automatically rebooting the chromebook... </p>
<p> so I went to the thing in the bottom right corner so I could connect to wifi and went into wifi settings and connected myself to the server and got to the how would you like to setup this device screen which only happens on personal devices so now that I got it on a school device it was unenrolled...</p>
<h3 id=3> What went wrong </h3>
<p> So since it was a personal device now I enabled developer mode connected to the server to unenroll... and it got stuck on loading... </p>
<p> so I wanted developer mode and in order to get developer mode I would need to think of a way to keep it </p>
<p> So I remember the first unenrollment that came after sh1mmer, see kernver doesn't apply in dev mode so I could downgrade to any version I wanted to </p>
<p> sure I wouldn't be unenrolled but I still could downgrade so what if I could downgrade and then do sh1mmer </p>
<p> Tried sh1mmer didn't really work... :( </p>
<p> So I tried the next exploit cryptosmite, that worked and I was unenrolled with dev mode </p>
<p> See the apps folder was GONE while unenrolled and I needed to use testnav to test back in the day so I used this thing called murkmod to enable dev mode and be unenrolled... but heres the thing the school admin found out and locked my device... which in turn caught me red handed...</p>
